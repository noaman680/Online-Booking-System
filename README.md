# Online Reservation System - Full Stack Application
This is a comprehensive, full-stack web application that provides a modern, interactive, and user-friendly interface for an online booking system. The project is built with a powerful Java Spring Boot backend API and a dynamic React frontend, demonstrating a complete separation of concerns and modern development practices.

# ‚ú® Key Features
# Frontend (User Interface)
Interactive Seat Map: A visually intuitive seat layout where users can see the status of each seat (Available, Reserved, Selected) in real-time.

Dynamic Booking Panel: A smart panel that updates instantly when a seat is selected, allowing users to enter their details and confirm their booking smoothly.

Secure User Authentication: A sleek, modal-based login system to ensure that only registered users can make reservations.

Real-time Feedback: The UI provides clear loading states, success messages, and error notifications to keep the user informed at all times.

Cancellation Module: Logged-in users can easily cancel their existing bookings using their PNR number.

Fully Responsive Design: The entire application is built with a mobile-first approach and is perfectly usable on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

# Backend (Server API)
RESTful API Architecture: A robust API built with Spring Boot that exposes clear endpoints for all frontend operations (fetching seats, creating reservations, etc.).

Structured Data Models: Uses well-defined Java classes for Seat and Reservation to ensure data integrity and easy management.

Service-Oriented Logic: The business logic for handling reservations and cancellations is neatly organized in a dedicated service layer, separate from the web controllers.

In-Memory Data Store: Currently uses an in-memory collection to manage seat and reservation data for simplicity and speed. This can be easily swapped with a persistent database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
This project is divided into two main parts:

# Backend:

Java 11+

Spring Boot: For creating a powerful and secure REST API.

Apache Maven: For project dependency management.

# Frontend:

React.js (with TypeScript): For building a fast, scalable, and type-safe user interface.

Tailwind CSS: For modern and responsive styling.

Axios/Fetch: For making API calls to the backend.

# üöÄ Getting Started
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

Prerequisites

The backend server will start on http://localhost:8080.

3. Run the Frontend Application
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

Bash

cd frontend
Install the necessary packages:

Bash

npm install
# or if you are using yarn
# yarn install
Start the React development server:

Bash

npm start
# or
# yarn start
The frontend application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

You can now use the application!

# üîÆ Future Enhancements
Database Integration: Replace the in-memory data store with a relational database like PostgreSQL to make data persistent.

Full User Authentication: Expand the login system with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and allow user registration.

Payment Gateway: Integrate a payment service like Stripe or Razorpay to handle booking payments.

Admin Dashboard: Create a separate view for administrators to manage trains, routes, and view all bookings.
